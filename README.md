# 🚀 SpaceTraders Game Simulator & Analyst

This project is a **real-time space trading simulation engine** built on top of the [SpaceTraders.io](https://spacetraders.io/) API. It simulates player actions such as travel, mining, and market interaction with realistic delays and state tracking. The system also includes a database-backed backend with route planning, fuel tracking, and early support for predictive analytics.

## 🛠️ Features

### ✅ Real-Time Game Simulation
- Asynchronous event handling (e.g., travel, mining, docking).
- Uses `asyncio` to simulate real-time travel durations.
- Event consumers powered by **Kafka**.

### 🌌 Universe Mapping & Navigation
- Complete universe mapped and stored with coordinates using **PostGIS**.
- Real-time ship location updates and travel path simulation.
- Distance calculation between waypoints using geospatial data.

### 🚢 Ship Management
- Tracks individual ships’ fuel, location, navigation state (DOCKED, IN_ORBIT, IN_TRANSIT).
- Automatically transitions between DOCKED ↔ ORBIT ↔ TRANSIT.
- Logs all trips with timestamps and travel durations.

### ⛽ Fuel & Travel Analytics
- Logs fuel usage for all travel events.
- Warns when a trip might fail due to insufficient fuel.
- Plans for ML-based prediction of fuel requirements based on:
  - Ship type
  - Distance
  - Historical travel logs

### 🧠 Planned Enhancements
- Smart `start_trip` validator with fuel & cooldown checks.
- Predictive travel planning (ETA, refuel suggestions).
- Streamlit dashboard to visualize universe, ship paths, and analytics.
- Autonomous trader bot to monitor markets and plan profitable trades.

## ⚡ Example Travel Event

```json
{
  "type": "start_trip",
  "player_token": "your-agent-token",
  "ship_symbol": "SUJAL-1",
  "destination_waypoint": "X1-GP53-B39"
}
```

The system:

1. Undocks if needed.
2. Checks ship fuel and travel status.
3. Sends a `/navigate` POST request.
4. Waits for arrival (e.g. `await asyncio.sleep(duration)`).
5. Updates DB on arrival.

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

* If fuel is insufficient, the SpaceTraders API returns a generic `400` error.
* Fuel estimation isn't available via the API — we log historical data to build our own predictive model.
* Currently lacks automatic refueling and cooldown management.

---

## 🧠 Future Plans

* 📊 **Fuel Predictor Model**: Estimate required fuel for trips based on historical records.
* 🤖 **Autonomous Trader Bot**: Buy/sell goods intelligently across systems.
* 🛰️ **Multi-Ship Event Management**: Handle fleets concurrently.
* 📉 **Dashboard**: Web UI for ship stats, travel logs, and trade performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* PostgreSQL with PostGIS
* Docker (for Kafka setup)

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Kafka + PostgreSQL via Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Start the Kafka consumer
python src/main.py
```

Let me know if you'd like me to:
- Add images or diagrams (e.g. architecture flow).
- Include sample `.env` setup or Docker Compose file.
- Write up API reference for your `Player`, `Ship`, or `start_trip` logic.

Want me to push this as a `README.md` file into your local directory or a GitHub repo?
